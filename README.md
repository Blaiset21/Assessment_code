Hello,
In order to get this to work very little needs to be done
run npm install to install all the pacakge
it should run on nodejs with node app.mjs
the port currently is localhost 3000

I Plan to redo this with react as it is one of the modules being taught however, I have not learnt it yet so I am wating for it to be learnt
